Network-CO2-SAT (a CO₂ and surface air temperature impact assessment tool) is a network model constructed based on complex network methods. Following the complex network modeling framework, Network-CO2-SAT represents observation stations as nodes and nonlinear causal relationships as edges. The model operates on a daily time step and can reveal the causal connectivity characteristics and influence mechanisms between CO₂ concentration and surface air temperature
